#test 4
#check for error token - make sure it is generated in the output from program 2
input a
input b
print c % d
#you should not see d in the output from program 2, it should stop after the %
#make sure the error token is in the test file

#test 5 - bonus test
create an empty file, from windows just do this from the command line:
c> copy con file5.txt and hit enter, then press F6 right away - it will show ^Z. This will create a file of 0 bytes
See if the programs recognize a file of no tokens - if it doesn't work with the better students stop trying it, 
it's just an idea
